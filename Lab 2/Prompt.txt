In this part of the assignment, you will change the scheduler from a simple round-robin to a priority scheduler. 
Add a priority value to each process (lets say taking a range between 0 to 31). The range does not matter, it is just a proof of concept. 
When scheduling from the ready list you will always schedule the highest priority thread/process first. 
All the processes should have a default initial priority of 10.

Add a system call to change the priority of a process. A process can change its priority at any time. 
If the priority becomes lower than any process on the ready list, you must switch to that process.

Goals: Understand how the scheduler works. Understand how to implement a scheduling policy and characterize its impact on performance. 
Understand priority inversion and a possible solution for it.
